/*The Antique Comedians of Malidinesia prefer comedies to tragedies. Unfortunately, most of the ancient plays are tragedies. 
Therefore the dramatic advisor of ACM has decided to transfigure some tragedies into comedies. Obviously, this work is very 
hard because the basic sense of the play must be kept intact, although all the things change to their opposites. 
For example the numbers: if any number appears in the tragedy, it must be converted to its reversed form before being 
accepted into the comedy play.

Reversed number is a number written in arabic numerals but the order of digits is reversed. The first digit becomes last 
and vice versa. For example, if the main hero had 1245 strawberries in the tragedy, he has 5421 of them now. Note that all 
the leading zeros are omitted. That means if the number ends with a zero, the zero is lost by reversing (e.g. 1200 gives 21). 
Also note that the reversed number never has any trailing zeros.

ACM needs to calculate with reversed numbers. Your task is to add two reversed numbers and output their reversed sum.
Of course, the result is not unique because any particular number is a reversed form of several numbers (e.g. 21 could be 12, 
120 or 1200 before reversing). Thus we must assume that no zeros were lost by reversing (e.g. assume that the original number 
was 12).*/

function reversedSum(num, num2){
    var number = num.toString().split("").reverse().join("");
    var number2 = num2.toString().split("").reverse().join("");
    var reversed = (+number) + (+number2);
     var reverseAgain = reversed.toString().split("").reverse();
    for(var i=0; i<reverseAgain.length; i++){
        if(reverseAgain[i]==="0"){
            reverseAgain.splice(i, 1);
            i--;
        }
        else{
            break;
        }
    }
    
   
    return reverseAgain.join("");
}
reversedSum(305, 794)
//returns 1
reversedSum(4358, 754)
//returns 1998
reversedSum(24, 1)
//returns 34
